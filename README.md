# 🧠 AI Text Humanizer

Welcome to **AI Text Humanizer** — an open-source project that transforms robotic, AI-generated writing into fluent, natural, and human-like text.

Our goal for **Hacktoberfest 2025** is to build a **full-scale, industry-level humanizer**, powered by community contributions. 🚀  

---

## 💡 Overview

This project includes **two unique Python-based humanizers**:

| Humanizer | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| 🟢 **Balanced** | Focuses on clarity, grammar, and readability while keeping the tone close to the original. |
| 🔴 **Aggressive** | Performs stronger rephrasing and stylistic variation for creative, natural output. |

Both versions use modern NLP tools — **Transformers**, **spaCy**, **TextStat**, and **NLTK** — to refine grammar, coherence, and tone.

## ⚙️ Features
✅ Text rephrasing with variable creativity  
✅ Grammar & readability improvement
