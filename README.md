# 🧠 AI Text Humanizer

Welcome to **AI Text Humanizer** — an open-source project that transforms robotic, AI-generated writing into fluent, natural, and human-like text.

Our goal for **Hacktoberfest 2025** is to build a **full-scale, industry-level humanizer**, powered by community contributions. 🚀

---

## Overview

This project contains two Python humanizers:

- 🟢 **Balanced** — preserves meaning and prioritizes grammar & readability.  
- 🔴 **Aggressive** — stronger rephrasing and stylistic variation (more creative).

Both use modern NLP tools (Transformers, spaCy, TextStat, NLTK) to refine grammar and tone.
