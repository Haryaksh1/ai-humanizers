# 🧠 AI Text Humanizer Welcome to **AI Text Humanizer** — an open-source project featuring two intelligent text rewriters that turn mechanical or AI-generated writing into fluent, natural-sounding language. ## 💡 Overview This project includes **two unique Python-based humanizers**: | Humanizer | Description | |------------|--------------| | 🟢 **Balanced** | Focuses on clarity, grammar, and readability while keeping the tone similar to the input. | | 🔴 **Aggressive** | Performs stronger rephrasing and stylistic variation, perfect for making text sound creatively human. | Both versions leverage modern NLP tools such as **Transformers**, **spaCy**, **TextStat**, and **NLTK** for grammatical and stylistic refinement. --- ## 🚀 Getting Started ### Clone the Repository
